# [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) - The Linux Fork (desktop-drac)

[![CI / Linux](https://github.com/xi72yow/desktop-drac/actions/workflows/ci-linux.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/xi72yow/desktop-drac/actions/workflows/ci-linux.yml)

[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is an open-source [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)-based
GitHub app. It is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and
uses [React](https://reactjs.org/).

**desktop-drac** is a community-maintained Linux fork, originally based on
[shiftkey/desktop](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop) (no longer actively maintained),
now synced directly with the official [desktop/desktop](https://github.com/desktop/desktop) upstream.
